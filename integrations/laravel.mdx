## Overview

Use the [PkPayPlus PHP SDK](/integrations/php) inside your Laravel app. The SDK works with Laravel's config and environment.

**Quick setup:** Add your keys to `.env`, register the config in `config/services.php`, and instantiate the client with `config('services.pkpayplus')`. See the [PHP integration guide](/integrations/php#laravel-usage) for the full Laravel section.
